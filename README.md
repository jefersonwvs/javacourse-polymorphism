# Polymorphism

This repository is a simple project on polymorphism in the Java programming language. It contains a basic implementation of polymorphism using abstraction and inheritance.

_The implementation is based on a Java course available at Udemy, link: <https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/>_.
